          Across three distinct Chinatowns spanning Manhattan, Brooklyn, and
          Queens, generations of Chinese immigrants have woven vibrant
          tapestries of culture, commerce, and community that continue to evolve
          with each passing decade. The story of these neighborhoods is not just
          one of survival, but of resilience and adaptation, as they have
          navigated the complexities of urban life in one of the world's most
          dynamic cities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Businesses and people have opened, closed, changed, and adapted
          through decades of economic shifts, gentrification pressures, and
          cultural evolution, yet the soul of these neighborhoods remainsâ€”a
          testament to the enduring spirit of immigrant communities that have
          transformed urban spaces into homes away from home.

          Taken from the intersection of Division St and Market St looking at
          Forsyth St, this photo depicts street vendors selling a variety of
          goods, including produce, seafood, and household items. On the right
          is the past entrance to the East Broadway Mall, a shopping center that
          was once a bustling hub for Chinese-American businesses. The mall
          closed in 2019 due to economic challenges and changing consumer
          habits.

          locals.

          Doyers Street is a short street in Chinatown. Althought it was named
          after a Dutch tavern owner, a Chinese population bloomed around it in
          the late 1800s-early 1900s with a theater, tea house, and a post
          office. <span class="italic">Rice Terraces</span> (on the ground), a painting
          by Dasic Fernandez and a mural of Corky Lee (see below), are located on
          the street.

          Corky Lee (September 5, 1947 &hyphen; January 27, 2021) was a
          Chinese-American photojournalist and activist known for his work
          documenting an authentic and unmoderated view of the Asian-American
          experience. Famously describing his camera as a "weapon of injustice,"
          Lee's work often documented the struggles and triumphs of
          Asian-Americans not often seen in mainstream media. This mural,
          located on the corner of Doyers St and Bowery St, is a tribute to his
          legacy and impact on the Asian-American community.

          symbolizes good fortune and joy, while gold represents wealth and prosperity.
